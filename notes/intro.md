# Outline

Morning: 

9:30 - 10:00 - Setup and Introductions

10:00 - 12:15 - Project - Physical Computing and Intro to Programming

Arduino project leading us through introductions to data/metadata, git/github, programming, web publishing, cloud … 

What is data/metadata? 
What is git/version control? 
What is HTML/CSS? 
What is the cloud? What is a database?

12:15 - 1:00 - Lunch

1:00 - 1:45 - Finish Up 

1:45 - 2:45 - Discussion and exploration 

Digital Humanities Pedagogy Packey

2:45 - 3:00 - Break

3:00 - 4:30 - Work on individual project; discuss and progress on collaborative project
Afternoon: 
Finish up arduino project
discuss individual projects
discuss initial readings, 
talk about outcomes for the week and collaborative project. 

Pedagogical Application: computational thinking, physical computing - project based learning / "media computing", "critical making"

## How the internet works

idealistic canadian vid: https://youtu.be/i5oe63pOhLI

http://example.com/about?key=value#anchor
URL = protocol + domain name (or IP, optional port :80) + path + query / parameters + fragment/anchor

demo IP addresses, `ping www.google.com` , `nslookup www.google.com` , `host www.google.com` , traceroute / tracert / tracepath `tracepath www.google.com` , `whois`

layers:
- Application Protocols Layer (http, ftp, smtp)
- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP, directs packets to specific applications using ports) 
- Internet Protocol Layer (IP, directs packets to specific machines)
- Hardware Layer (binary data to network signals)
