# Day Zero: Prep

1. Get a free [GitHub account](https://github.com/join). Think carefully about the user name you choose. It will be on your profile, web URLs, and associated with your work.
2. Please email your GitHub user name to Evan. Also include what operating system (OS), i.e. Windows or Mac, you use on your laptop.
3. We have purchased hosted accounts for each of you on [Reclaim Hosting](https://reclaimhosting.com). On Monday, we will be leading you through the process of signing up for an account, at which point you will have to provide a domain name/internet address for your account. *Before Monday, please think about a domain name.* If you'd like the site to be your profile page as well, you might get a url that includes your name. If you'd just like to use the domain to experiment with your classes, you might do something else. This will be one of your scholarly web homes and we don't want to put you on the spot to come up with a name!
4. Browse the readings. There are not too many now, and more may be coming as we get into the work. The first two readings on DH pedagogy will frame our first discussion on Tuesday morning. 
5. Bring along an assignment, lesson, or course idea to work on.
6. Browse the schedule outlines: [1](day-1.md) | [2](day-2.md) | [3](day-3.md) | [4](day-4.md) | [5](day-5.md)
