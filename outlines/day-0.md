# Day Zero: Prep

1. Get a free [GitHub account](https://github.com/join). If you want this to be a professional account, think about the user name you choose. It will be on your profile and web URLs.
2. Email your GitHub user name to Evan. Also include what OS you use on your laptop.
3. Think about a domain name. We will set up your scholarly web home and don't want to put you on the spot to come up with a name!
4. Browse the readings.
5. Bring along a assignment, lesson, or course idea to work on.
