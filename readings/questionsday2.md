- Will DH "save" the humanities? Does a neoliberal agenda drive this work? (to be cont. on Friday!)
    - We are all here because of the "justification" of DH. Thoughts?
    - At the same time, the digital divide is real and many students of all classes (esp. in Idaho) need to *not* be digitally challenged. 
- Along with that: reactions to this quote: no "army of app-building, HTML-typing twenty-somethings, but a stratified landscape in which some, mostly privileged, young people use their skills constructively, while others lack even basic Internet knowledged 
    - How do you allow for spectrum of knowledge? How do we encourage running up against limits, failures, etc. in such a way that students actually learn these technologies? 
- Conversation --> new phase; dominated not be ideas but once again by organizing activities, both in terms of organizing knowledge, and organizing ourselves and our work. 
    - How do you feel about teaching organizational skills? What are justifications for? What against? 
    - Is there a step after this move though? Is the ultimate skill "interpretation" or are these methods pointing out those end products, end projects, summary productions perhaps a trap in themselves? 
- Project based learning - already modeled in many classrooms. What does digital add? What does it subtract? 
    - How to incorporate experimentation? How to transpose research questions into DH spaces?
    - How do we embed the "skills habits, attitudes, and information [seeking]" into questions/tasks that compel students?

- How to keep that idea of limits forefront in this? 
    - can we plan limitations? reflection on their biggest failure? Points for trying? 
    - Value too to being taught code/tech isn't a quick fix. Actually often a long, roundabout to the same answers as before. 
- "Digital humanities pedagogy is most productive when it provokes us, and our students, to wrestle with the gap between what we wish to have, to do, to know, and what we are able to have, do, and know within disciplinary, technological, and institutional boundaries that are often surprisingly narrow."
    - How to parallel disciplinary limitations with technological limitations? 
    - Let's not forget interpersonal limitations!!!
- "Digital facsimiles and transcriptions can open doors to discovery. They can also pull them closed before our very eyes in those moments when we realize that we do not actually know what it is that we are seeing, either because of absent or faulty metadata, or because images can only convey so much. As Shillingsburg notes, even the most faithful reproductions are incomplete: “[I]mages have no weight, depth, texture, or smell and, thus, fail to give a palpable sense of structures, substance, and production; and transcriptions cannot capture every significant aspect of originals, particularly when the originals are manuscripts.” Here too, technological limits—along with limits of time, expertise, and institutional—further complicate attempts to provide accurate texts and images."

## Jackacki/Faull

- fundamental diff between DH pedagogy and integrated tech into classroom: "intentionality" of course learning goals. 
    - so much of our digital lives lack intention, e.g. Dropbox vs. GitHub comparison from yesterday. 
    - Modelling intentional digital action = good citizenship? critical thinking? 
- What did you all think of the class structure? 
    - Scaffolded assignments? 
    - Could you be comfortable *not* being the expert? Would your students be comfortable? 
- "One of the crucial decisions that must be made when undertaking such a course is *what kind of DATA* students will develop and use in the execution of the course goals"
- Adding theory. We just haven't yet. I'm hoping the DH incubator will help some. 
- How do you grade this?
